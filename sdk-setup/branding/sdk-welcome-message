  Welcome to the Mer Build Engine.

  Use "<host key> + F2" to get a console login prompt.
  On Linux the <host key> is usually <right-ctrl>.
  Virtualbox indicates the <host key> for your installation at the bottom right of this window.

  For more information including ssh connection and root access see:
